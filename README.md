## 🎯 Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the program, I encountered various challenges that pushed my problem-solving skills:

### Challenge 1: State Management Complexity
**Problem:** Managing complex state across multiple components in a large application.

**Solution:** Implemented a combination of React Context API for global state and local component state for UI-specific data. This hybrid approach reduced prop drilling while maintaining performance.

**Key Learnings:**
- When to use global vs local state
- Performance implications of context updates
- Custom hooks for reusable state logic

[View detailed challenges →](./challenges/README.md)

### Challenge 2: API Error Handling
**Problem:** Inconsistent error handling across different API endpoints leading to poor user experience.

**Solution:** Created a centralized error handling utility with custom error classes and user-friendly error messages. Implemented retry logic and fallback mechanisms.

**Key Learnings:**
- Standardized error response structures
- User-friendly error messaging
- Graceful degradation strategies

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
**Problem:** Initial page load times were slow, affecting user experience and SEO.

**Solution:** Implemented code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and caching strategies. Moved from client-side rendering to Next.js SSG where appropriate.

**Key Learnings:**
- Web vitals and performance metrics
- Bundle size optimization
- Strategic use of SSR vs SSG vs CSR
